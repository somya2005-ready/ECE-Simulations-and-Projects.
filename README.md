# ECE Projects and Simulations

## Overview
This repository contains my daily progress in Electronics and Communication Engineering topics such as:
- **Antenna Design** (e.g., UWB, microstrip patch antennas)
- **PCB Design** (e.g., high-frequency circuits, simple LED drivers)
- **IoT Projects** (e.g., smart home systems, weather monitoring)
- **VHDL Projects** (e.g., 4-bit adder, D flip-flop)

## Tools Used
- HFSS, CST Studio Suite
- KiCAD, Altium Designer
- Arduino IDE, Python
- VHDL Simulation Tools (ModelSim, Xilinx ISE)

## Repository Structure
- `Antenna_Design/`: Antenna simulations and results.
- `PCB_Design/`: PCB schematics, layouts, and fabrication-ready files.
- `IoT_Projects/`: IoT-based systems with source code and schematics.
- `VHDL_Projects/`: VHDL designs with testbenches and results.
- `Resources/`: Tutorials, references, and datasheets.
